This is the [https://villalba.is](https://villalba.is) landpage. 

# Bash

**portis.sh** run pandoc on GitHub Actions to create some html from the markdown files in the folder **content** and _cat_ them on _index.html_.

I use it only for this landpage, but easily can do the same to generate the hugo site behind.

The bash script run everytime I push this repository, and shows and error when are nothing new to it.
